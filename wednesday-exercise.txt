int score = 80; // A variable of type int and of name score is declared and is assigned a value of 80;

String result;  A reference variable of type String is declared and is 
		stored in the stack. Since the String has not been 
		assigned a value, there is nothing
		created in the string pool. An address of NULL 
		is stored with the "result" string name in the stack 

if (score == 80) {  'If' statement checking a boolean.  If the boolean 
			is TRUE then processing will be passed onto next line.
			Otherwise processing continues to the 'else if' line'
			
	result = "You passed!";  "You passed" is created in the string pool
				and the 'result' variable is updated with the 
				pool address of the string. 

} else if (score > 80) {  'else if' statement comparing the 'score' variable with
			   the value of 80.  If the value is greater than 80 
			   then processing will be passed on to the next line.
			   Otherwise processing continues to the 'else' line'
	
	result = "You did great!";  "You did great" is created in the string pool
				and the 'result' variable is updated with the 
				pool address of the string. 

} else {		   'else' statement that will pass the processing 
			    to the next line
	
	result = "You did not pass. Try again!"; "You did not pass. Try again" 
				is created in the string pool
				and the 'result' variable is updated with the 
				pool address of the string. 
}

System.out.println(result);  The 'result' string is sent to the SYSO processing
				and the string is printed to the console.
